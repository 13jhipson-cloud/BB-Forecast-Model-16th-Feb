# Why the `ScaledCohortAvg` row flipped variance positive

Your test result makes sense. `ScaledCohortAvg` is not a direct "set the month rate" control:

- It scales a rolling cohort average (lookback window), not a single fixed month rate.
- If the underlying rolling average in MOB 4/5 differs from the backtest month’s required rate, a single scale factor can over-correct one month.
- So a ratio fitted on Oct+Nov total can still produce a positive variance in each month (or vice versa).

# If you want to hit known Oct/Nov actuals more directly

Use `Manual` rows for exact MOBs in backtest months per cohort:

`target_rate = Actual_Coll_Principal / Forecast_OpeningGBV`

This directly targets month-level amount for those MOB points.

Generated patch for top 5 worst negative Oct+Nov cohorts:

- `Rate_Methodology_patch_top5_manual_mob_oct_nov.csv`

Generated by script:

- `tools/generate_manual_rate_patch_from_backtest.py`

Example command:

```bash
python tools/generate_manual_rate_patch_from_backtest.py \
  --xlsx 'BB Forecast V5.2.xlsx' \
  --months 2025-10,2025-11 \
  --top-n 5 \
  --out Rate_Methodology_patch_top5_manual_mob_oct_nov.csv
```

After you validate this closes Oct/Nov, we can convert these temporary Manual points into nearby regime rules (donor/ScaledDonor/CohortAvg windows) for forward plausibility.
